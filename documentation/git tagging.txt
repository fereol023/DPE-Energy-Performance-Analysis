"Check branch name and commit message", the script checks the name of the current branch and the commit message of the most recent commit to determine whether a new tag should be created and what the tag name should be. If the current branch is "main" and the commit message contains the word "final", the tag will be created with the format major.minor+1 (e.g. 1.2.3 -> 1.3.0). If the current branch is not "main" or the commit message does not contain "final", the script checks the latest tag to see if it ends with "-rc" and an integer. If it does, the tag will be created with the format major.minor.rc-x where x is the integer incremented by 1 (e.g. 1.2.rc-1 -> 1.2.rc-2). If the latest tag does not end with "-rc", the tag will be created with the format major.minor.rc-0.
